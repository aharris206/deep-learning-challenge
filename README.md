# deep-learning-challenge
## Module 21 • `2023-05-21T23:36−07:00 (PDT)`

- The File `Code_Progress.ipynb` contains my progress in this module challenge before the deadline of `2023-05-21T23:59−07:00 (PDT)`.
- The instructions said *"The instructions below are now updated to use Google Colab for this assignment instead of Jupyter Notebook.* ***If you have already started this assignment using a Jupyter Notebook then you can continue to use Jupyter instead of Google Colab."*** Because I had already started it in a Jupyter Notebook, I did just that.
- The place where I got ***stuck*** was in exporting the results to an HDF5 file named `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`. With less then 30 minutes until the assignment is due and no time to troubleshoot, I am submitting what I have completed so far.
